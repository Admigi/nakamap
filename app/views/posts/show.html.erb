    <h2 class="subtitle">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h2>
    <h1 class="intro-p">Todai-ji, meaning "Great Eastern Temple," was originally constructed in 752 during the Nara period (710-794) by Emperor Shomu. The temple was envisioned as a center for Buddhist learning and played a crucial role in promoting Buddhism as the state religion. The construction of Todai-ji was part of a larger plan to solidify the emperor's control over the country and bring about a sense of unity.</h1>

          <p>At the heart of Todai-ji Temple stands the Daibutsuden, or the Great Buddha Hall, which is one of the largest wooden structures in the world. The hall houses a colossal bronze statue of Buddha known as the Daibutsu, or Great Buddha. Cast in 746, the statue is an awe-inspiring representation of Vairocana, the cosmic Buddha. Standing at over 15 meters in height, the Great Buddha exudes a sense of tranquility and spiritual grace.</p>
          <p>The construction of the Great Buddha Hall was not without challenges. The original structure was even more massive, but due to various natural disasters and reconstruction efforts, the present-day hall is two-thirds of its original size. Nonetheless, it remains a masterpiece of Japanese architecture, showcasing intricate details and meticulous craftsmanship.</p>
